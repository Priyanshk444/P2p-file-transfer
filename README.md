## Getting Started

This is a Peer to peer file transfer Application that uses P2P type of connection to transfer file or folder from one device to another. This app also supports the feature of sending and recieving real time message.

## Technology used
we have used web socket class of Java to implement this.

## Upcoming feature
- support multiple peer connection
- ensure security
- many more....

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
